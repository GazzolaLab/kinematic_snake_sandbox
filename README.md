# Snake Kinematics Sandbox

A sandbox to play around with a kinematic model of snake-locomotion, with and
without active frictional modulation.

The online sandbox can be seen [here](https://gazzolalab.github.io/kinematic_snake_sandbox/).
The numerical code powering the simulator can be found here : TODO
