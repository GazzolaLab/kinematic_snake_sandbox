# Snake Kinematics Sandbox

An interactive online sandbox to play around with a kinematic model of snake-locomotion, with and
without active frictional modulation.

> :rocket: The online sandbox can be seen [here](https://gazzolalab.github.io/kinematic_snake_sandbox/).

The numerical code (written in `Python`) powering the simulator [can be found here](https://github.com/tp5uiuc/kinematic_snake).

## What is it?
An online, interactive simulator that provides intuition for the behavior of a snake as it adapts its gait in terrains of various nature.
